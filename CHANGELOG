      of '-r|--recent'
[Fix] util-linux 2.23 supports 'column' command with '-o' but earlier versions do not, resulting in scan reports
      generating empty hit lists

      and import_custsigs_hex_url
[Fix] multiplying maldet monitor processes due to 'ps' command expansion under parent bash process on CentOS6
