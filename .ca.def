# Cpanel suspend or set shell /bin/false on non-Cpanel

# [ SCAN OPTIONS ]
##

# [ changing this may have an impact on scan performance ]

# Attempt to detect the presence of ClamAV clamscan binary

# Allow non-root users to perform malware scans. This must be
# enabled when using mod_security2 upload scanning or if you
# want to allow users to perform scans. When enabled, this will
# populate the /usr/local/maldetect/pub/ path with user owned
# quarantine, session and temporary paths to faciliate scans.
# These paths are populated through cron every 10min with the
# /etc/cron.d/maldet_pub cronjob.

##
# [ STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ]
##
# The string length test is used to identify threats based on the
# length of the longest uninterrupted string within a file. This is
# useful as obfuscated code is often stored using encoding methods
# that produce very long strings without spaces (e.g: base64)
# [ string length in characters, default = 150000 ]

# [ MONITORING OPTIONS ]
##
# The base number of files that can be watched under a path
# [ maximum file watches = inotify_base_watches*users ]

# The sleep time in seconds between monitor runs to scan files
# that have been created/modified/moved

# the USERS option is specified

# this option is set, users will only have the webdir monitored
# [ clear option to default monitor entire user homedir ]
